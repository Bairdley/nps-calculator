##Synopsis

This tool calculates Net Promoter Score based on a user's total Promoters, Neutrals, and Detractors.

##Motivation

There are many NPS calculators available online, but the real reason someone would use a calculator like this is because they are trying to reach a goal. 

This calculator allows the user to set an NPS goal, and then the difference between their current NPS and their goal NPS (how many more Promoters are needed) is determined.
